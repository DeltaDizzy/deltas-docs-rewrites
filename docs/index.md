# Welcome to my-frc-docs

While the main FRC docs site at [https://docs.wpilib.org](https://docs.wpilib.org) is a fantastic resource, sections have come in need of major rewrites. This is hard to do if the site is written with rookies as the main audience. A reorganization is underway behind the scenes to remedy this, but little is known about it and so I made this site as a repository for much rewrites until the reorg is done. At that point, the intent is for the content housed here to be PRd to the main site.
